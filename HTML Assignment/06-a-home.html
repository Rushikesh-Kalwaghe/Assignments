    <h1> <u> Sports: </u> </h1>
    <p>Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone; at any age and any point in life. Adults, children
        and elders – everyone alike can take part in sports. Many regard sports as a mere co-curricular or
        extra-curricular activity in schools. However, in reality, sports play an equally important role as does
        education in a person’s life. To achieve overall and all-round development in life, one should be well-versed in
        both sports and culture. While training sharpens the mind, sports sharpens the body and fitness. Thus, both are
        essential. </p>

    <p> There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports. First and foremost, as known by all and very
        definitively, competitions increase the physical fitness of an individual. Additionally, sports also contribute
        to building stable mental well-being of a person. Various researchers show that people who are in the daily
        practice of sports in any form record better mental as well as physical health. Moreover, sports also eliminates
        the risk of a person catching diseases or facing any bodily interruptions. Competitions increase immunity and
        increase people’s stamina.</p>
